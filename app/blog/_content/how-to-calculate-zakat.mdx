  - question: "Do I calculate Zakat on my salary or my savings?"
    answer: "Zakat is calculated on your total wealth (savings, assets, etc.), not your income. However, if your salary sits in your bank account long enough to complete a Hawl, it becomes part of your zakatable wealth."
  - question: "What if I'm exactly at the Nisab threshold?"
    answer: "If you're exactly at Nisab, Zakat is due. When in doubt, it's better to give."
  - question: "Is Zakat al-Fitr the same as annual Zakat?"
    answer: "No. Zakat al-Fitr is a separate charity paid during Ramadan before Eid prayer. It has no Nisab requirement."
  - question: "Can I give Zakat to my struggling sibling or cousin?"
    answer: "Yes, as long as they're not your direct ancestors, descendants, or spouse. Giving to relatives is actually preferred if they're eligible."
  - question: "What if my wealth fluctuates throughout the year?"
    answer: "As long as you stay above Nisab at both the beginning and end of your Hawl, Zakat is due, even if you dipped in between (as long as you didn't go below Nisab for an extended period)."

Last Ramadan, Ahmad thought he was fulfilling his Zakat obligation correctly until he discovered he'd been calculating it wrong for three years. He'd forgotten to include his investment accounts, deduct his debts, and was using an outdated Nisab value from a random website.

If you've ever stared at your bank statements wondering "Do I owe Zakat on this?" or "How exactly do I calculate 2.5%?" - this guide is for you.

## What is Zakat and Why Does Calculation Matter?

**Zakat** is third of the five Pillars of Islam, an obligatory act of worship where Muslims give 2.5% of their qualifying wealth to those in need. But unlike prayer or fasting, Zakat requires precise calculation and getting it wrong can mean either shortchanging the poor or overburdening yourself.

Allah (subhanallahu wa ta'ala) said:

> _"Take, [O Muḥammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allāh's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allāh is Hearing and Knowing."_ — [Quran 9:103](https://quran.com/9/103)

Calculating Zakat correctly ensures you fulfill this pillar properly while maximizing the benefit to those who receive it.

## The Four Types of Zakatable Wealth in Islam

Before diving into calculations, it's important to understand that Zakat applies to **four main categories** of wealth, each with its own rules:

1.  **Money and Financial Assets** (cash, savings, stocks, gold, silver)
2.  **Agricultural Produce** (crops and fruits)
3.  **Livestock** (camels, cattle, sheep, goats)
4.  **Trade Goods** (business inventory intended for sale)

> **Note:** This guide focuses specifically on calculating Zakat on **money and financial assets**, as this is what applies to most Muslims today. If you own agricultural land or livestock, see the links below for more information.

## Step 1: Determine if You've Reached Nisab

Before calculating anything, you need to know if Zakat is even obligatory on you. This is determined by the **Nisab** (the minimum threshold of wealth you must possess).

### Current Nisab Values

There are two Nisab thresholds based on precious metals:

- **Gold Nisab:** 87.48 grams of gold (~$14,200 USD as of 15th Feb 2026)
- **Silver Nisab:** 612.36 grams of silver (~$1,500 USD as of 15th Feb 2026)

Most scholars recommend using the **silver Nisab** because it benefits more people in need. You can check today's exact Nisab value in your currency using our [Nisab Tracker](https://www.nisabtracker.com).

### The Key Question

**Have you possessed wealth above Nisab for one full lunar year (Hawl)?**

If yes, continue to Step 2. If no, Zakat is not yet obligatory on you.

## Step 2: Calculate Your Total Zakatable Assets

Now it's time to add up everything you own that qualifies for Zakat.

### What DOES Count Toward Zakat

✅ **Cash**

- Money in your wallet
- Cash at home
- Cash in bank accounts (checking, savings, etc.)

✅ **Precious Metals**

- Gold (jewelry, coins, bars)
- Silver (jewelry, coins, bars)
- Platinum and other precious metals

> **Note on Jewelry:** Scholars differ on whether gold/silver jewelry worn regularly for adornment is zakatable. The **Hanafi** school says it is zakatable, while **Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali** schools say it is not if worn regularly. To be safe, many scholars recommend including it. Read the full discussion: [Islam Question & Answer - Zakat on Gold Jewelry](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59866)

✅ **Investments**

- Stocks and shares
- Bonds and mutual funds
- Cryptocurrency
- Investment accounts (401k, IRA, pension funds — scholars differ; many say Zakat is due on the current value)

✅ **Business Assets**

- Inventory intended for sale
- Business profits
- Receivables (money owed to you that you expect to receive)

✅ **Loans You've Given**

- Money you've lent to others (if you expect to get it back)

### What Does NOT Count Toward Zakat

❌ **Personal Use Items**

- Your home (primary residence)
- Your car
- Clothes and household items
- Furniture and appliances
- Tools and equipment you use for work
- Food and groceries

❌ **Fixed Assets**

- Real estate you're not selling (only the rental income counts, not the property value)
- Business equipment and machinery

### Example Calculation: Ahmad's Assets

Let's say Ahmad is calculating his Zakat on **Ramadan 1, 1447** (February 2026). Here's what he owns:
| Asset | Amount |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Cash in wallet | $200 |
| Checking account | $1,500 |
| Savings account | $8,000 |
| Gold jewelry (18k, 50g pure gold) | $3,200 |
| Stocks (current value) | $5,000 |
| Money owed to him by friend | $500

**Total Assets**

**$18,400**

## Step 3: Subtract Debts and Immediate Expenses

From your total assets, you can subtract:

✅ **Debts You Owe**

- Personal loans
- Credit card debt
- Money you've borrowed from others
- Outstanding bills

### Ahmad's Debts

| Debt                  | Amount |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| Money owed to brother | $300   |
| This month's rent     | $800   |

**Total Debts**

**$1,100**

### Ahmad's Net Zakatable Wealth

**Total Assets** - **Total Debts** = **Net Zakatable Wealth**

$18,400 - $1,100 = **$17,300**

## Step 4: Verify You've Held This Wealth for a Full Lunar Year (Hawl)

This is crucial and often overlooked.

### The Hawl Rule

You must have possessed wealth **above Nisab** for one complete **lunar year**.

**Important points:**

- If your wealth dips below Nisab at any point during the year, the Hawl **resets**
- You don't need to have the exact same dollars — wealth can fluctuate, but it must stay above Nisab
- The lunar year starts from the day you first reached Nisab

### Ahmad's Situation

Ahmad first reached Nisab on **Ramadan 1, 1446** (February 2025). He's now calculating on **Ramadan 1, 1447** (February 2026) — exactly one lunar year later. His wealth stayed above Nisab throughout the year.

✅ **Hawl is complete** → Zakat is due

## Step 5: Calculate 2.5% Zakat

This is the easiest step. Simply multiply your net zakatable wealth by **0.025** (which is 2.5%).

### The Formula

**Zakat Amount = Net Zakatable Wealth × 0.025**

Or if you prefer:

**Zakat Amount = Net Zakatable Wealth × 2.5 ÷ 100**

### Ahmad's Zakat Calculation

$17,300 × 0.025 = **$432.50**

Ahmad owes **$432.50** in Zakat for this lunar year.

### Quick Reference: Zakat Amounts by Wealth

| If Your Net Wealth Is | Your Zakat Is |
| :-------------------: | :-----------: |
|        $1,000         |      $25      |
|        $5,000         |     $125      |
|        $10,000        |     $250      |
|        $20,000        |     $500      |
|        $50,000        |    $1,250     |
|       $100,000        |    $2,500     |

## Step 6: Distribute Your Zakat to Eligible Recipients

Once you've calculated your Zakat, you need to give it to those who qualify. The Quran specifies eight categories of people eligible to receive Zakat:

1.  **The Poor** (Al-Fuqara) — those with little to no income
2.  **The Needy** (Al-Masakin) — those who lack basic necessities
3.  **Zakat Administrators** — those who collect and distribute Zakat
4.  **Those Whose Hearts Are to Be Reconciled** — new Muslims or those inclined toward Islam
5.  **Those in Bondage** — freeing slaves (historically)
6.  **Those in Debt** — people struggling with debt
7.  **In the Cause of Allah** — for Islamic projects and missionaries
8.  **Travelers in Need** — stranded travelers

> _"Zakāh expenditures are only for the poor and for the needy and for those employed for it1 and for bringing hearts together [for Islām] and for freeing captives [or slaves] and for those in debt and for the cause of Allāh and for the [stranded] traveler - an obligation [imposed] by Allāh. And Allāh is Knowing and Wise."_ — [Quran 9:60](https://quran.com/9/60)

### Where NOT to Give Zakat

You **cannot** give your Zakat to:

- Your parents, grandparents, or direct ancestors
- Your children, grandchildren, or direct descendants
- Your spouse
- Non-Muslims (except those whose hearts are being reconciled to Islam)

## Common Mistakes When Calculating Zakat

### ❌ Mistake 1: "I'll just estimate"

**Reality:** Estimation often leads to underpayment. Take 30 minutes to calculate properly — it's a pillar of Islam.

### ❌ Mistake 2: "I pay Zakat every Ramadan, so I don't need to track the Hawl"

**Reality:** Your Hawl might not align with Ramadan. If you first reached Nisab in Dhul-Hijjah, that's when your Hawl completes, not Ramadan.

### ❌ Mistake 3: "I only calculate once and pay the same amount every year"

**Reality:** Your wealth changes, Nisab values fluctuate daily, and your debts vary. Recalculate every year.

### ❌ Mistake 4: "Gold jewelry I wear doesn't count"

**Reality:** As mentioned earlier, this is an area of scholarly difference. To be safe, include all gold and silver. Read: [Islam Question & Answer - Zakat on Jewelry](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59866)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I calculate Zakat on my salary or my savings?

**A:** Zakat is calculated on your **total wealth** (savings, assets, etc.), not your income. However, if your salary sits in your bank account long enough to complete a Hawl, it becomes part of your zakatable wealth.

### Q: What if I'm exactly at the Nisab threshold?

**A:** If you're exactly at Nisab, Zakat is due. When in doubt, it's better to give.

### Q: Is Zakat al-Fitr the same as annual Zakat?

**A:** No. **Zakat al-Fitr** is a separate charity paid during Ramadan before Eid prayer. It has no Nisab requirement. Read: [Islam Question & Answer - Zakat al-Fitr](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/207225)

### Q: Can I give Zakat to my struggling sibling or cousin?

**A:** Yes, as long as they're not your direct ancestors, descendants, or spouse. Giving to relatives is actually preferred if they're eligible.

### Q: What if my wealth fluctuates throughout the year?

**A:** As long as you stay **above Nisab** at both the beginning and end of your Hawl, Zakat is due, even if you dipped in between (as long as you didn't go below Nisab for an extended period).
