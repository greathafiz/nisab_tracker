Nisab is one of the most important concepts in Islamic finance, yet many Muslims struggle to understand exactly what it means and how it affects their Zakat obligations. In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down everything you need to know about Nisab.

## What does Nisab mean?

**Nisab** (نِصاب) is the minimum amount of wealth a Muslim must possess before they are obligated to pay Zakat. Think of it as a threshold; if your wealth is below this threshold, you don't owe Zakat. If it's above, you must pay 2.5% of your qualifying wealth as Zakat.

The word "Nisab" comes from the Arabic root "n-s-b" (نصب), which means "to set up" or "to establish." In Islamic jurisprudence, it refers to the established minimum threshold for Zakat.

## Why is Nisab important?

Nisab serves several crucial purposes in Islamic finance:

1. **Protects the Poor**: Nisab ensures that only those who have sufficient wealth pay Zakat. It prevents financial hardship on those who are struggling themselves.

2. **Standardizes Zakat**: By setting a clear threshold, Nisab provides a universal standard for when Zakat becomes obligatory, removing ambiguity.

3. **Reflects Economic Reality**: The Nisab is tied to precious metals (gold and silver), which helps it maintain relevance across different economies and time periods.

4. **Encourages Wealth Circulation**: By requiring those above the threshold to give, Nisab helps redistribute wealth in society and prevent hoarding.

## The Two Types of Nisab

There are two primary Nisab thresholds in Islam, both established by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):

### 1. Gold Nisab

**87.48 grams (approximately 3 ounces) of pure gold**

The Nisab for gold is 20 Mithqals (gold units of weight). Each Mithqal weighs 4.374 grams based on the historical weight standard of the Prophetic-era Dinar, making the total 87.48 grams of pure gold. This is based on the hadith narrated by Ali ibn Abi Talib (may Allah be pleased with him), in which the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:

> _"When you possess two hundred dirhams and one year passes on them, five dirhams are payable. Nothing is incumbent on you in gold, till it reaches twenty dinars. When you possess twenty dinars and one year passes on them, half a dinar is payable..."_ - [Sunan Abu Dawud, Hadith 1573](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:1573)

**Note:** Some scholars round this down to 85 grams (using 4.25g per Mithqal). The 87.48g figure is based on the more precise historical weight of the Prophetic-era Dinar and is used by most major Islamic charitable organizations today.

### 2. Silver Nisab

**612.36 grams (approximately 21 ounces) of pure silver**

The Nisab for silver is 200 Dirhams (silver units of weight). Each Dirham weighs 3.0618 grams based on the historical weight standard, making the total 612.36 grams of pure silver. This is confirmed by the same hadith above (Sunan Abu Dawud 1573), as well as the hadith narrated by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him):

> _"No Zakat is imposed on less than five Awsuq of dates; no Zakat is imposed on less than five Awaq of silver, and no Zakat is imposed on less than five camels."_ - [Sahih al-Bukhari, Hadith 1459](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:1459)

Five Awaq (uqiyah) of silver equals 200 dirhams, which is 612.36 grams of silver.

**Note:** Some scholars round this down to 595 grams (using 2.975g per Dirham). Like the gold Nisab, the 612.36g figure is based on the more precise historical Dirham weight and is the standard used by most major Islamic charitable organizations today.

## Which Nisab Should You Use?

This is a common question, and scholars have different opinions. You can read a detailed scholarly discussion on this topic at [Islam Question & Answer](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/370380). However, the summary is that most scholars recommend **Silver Nisab.**

**Why?** Because the silver Nisab is lower in monetary value, meaning more people qualify to pay Zakat. This benefits the poor and needy, which aligns with the essence of Zakat.

As at the time of writing, Gold Nisab (85g) is approximately $5,500 while Silver Nisab (595g) is approximately $450. Using the silver Nisab means you'd pay Zakat if you have $450+ in savings for a full lunar year, while the gold Nisab would require $5,500+.

However, scholars say: "use Gold Nisab." arguing it better reflects the economic reality of modern times. However, this remains a minority opinion for general wealth-based Zakat.

### **Our Recommendation**

At Nisab Tracker, we display both values and let you choose. However, we recommend the **silver Nisab** for most people, as it:

- Helps more people in need
- Is more cautious (better to give when in doubt)
- Aligns with the majority scholarly opinion

## How to Calculate if You've Reached Nisab

Here's a simple step-by-step process. For a more detailed guide on calculating Zakat on your savings, see [Islam Question & Answer's guide on Zakat on savings](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/50801).

### Step 1: Calculate Your Zakatable Wealth

Add up:

- Cash in hand and in bank accounts
- Savings
- Gold and silver (jewelry, coins, etc.)
- Business inventory and profits
- Money owed to you (that you expect to receive)
- Stocks, bonds, and investment accounts

### Step 2: Subtract Your Debts

Subtract:

- Money you owe to others
- Immediate expenses (rent, bills due this month)

### Step 3: Compare to Nisab

Check if your net wealth is above the current Nisab value (use our [Nisab Tracker](/) for real-time values in 20+ currencies).

### Step 4: Check the Hawl (Lunar Year)

You must have possessed wealth above the Nisab for one full lunar year (354 days) before Zakat is due. If your wealth drops below Nisab at any point during the year, the Hawl resets. Read more about how this works at [Islam Question & Answer](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/99381).

## Real-World Example

**Ahmad's Situation:**

- Savings: $3,000
- Gold jewelry: $1,500
- Money owed to him: $500
- **Total Zakatable Wealth: $5,000**
- Debts: $800
- **Net Wealth: $4,200**

**Current Silver Nisab: $450**

Since $4,200 > $450, Ahmad has reached Nisab. If he's held this wealth for a full lunar year, he owes Zakat of 2.5% × $4,200 = **$105**.

## Common Misconceptions About Nisab

### ❌ Myth 1: "Nisab is a fixed dollar amount"

**✅ Reality:** Nisab changes daily based on gold and silver prices. That's why you need a tracker!

### ❌ Myth 2: "I only pay Zakat once I reach Nisab"

**✅ Reality:** You must maintain wealth above Nisab for a full lunar year before Zakat is due. If your wealth dips below Nisab during that year, the clock resets. Learn more about [how wealth changes during the year affect your Hawl](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/99381).

### ❌ Myth 3: "Personal items count toward Nisab"

**✅ Reality:** Your home, car, clothes, and items for personal use don't count. Only wealth you could potentially use or invest counts.

### ❌ Myth 4: "Gold jewelry I wear definitely doesn't count"

**✅ Reality:** This is actually an area where scholars differ. The Hanafis hold that Zakat is obligatory on all gold and silver regardless of whether it is worn, while the majority of Malikis, Shafis, and Hanbalis say it is not obligatory on jewelry worn for adornment. However, many scholars recommend paying Zakat on worn jewelry to be on the safe side. Read the full scholarly discussion at [Islam Question & Answer](https://islamqa.info/en/answers/59866).
